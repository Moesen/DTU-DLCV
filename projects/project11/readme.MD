# Project 1

### *Remote (hpc): From dtu folder -> personal folder*
Otherwise look at scp commands, the script `.load_hpc_local.sh`, should give a hint as to how that could be done

### *Local: Download data to local machine*
Use `make data_local` to download data from hpc to local machine. The download uses `scp` and you need to provide password on use of command
