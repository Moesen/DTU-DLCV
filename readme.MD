## Notes
### **Link to overview of optuna and wandb integration for creating cool sweep plots**
[https://www.h4pz.co/blog/2020/10/3/optuna-and-wandb](Link)

## **Note about wandb**
To make wandb work without logging in, set api key in environment.
Key should have name:
`WANDB_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

### *Make src package imports work*
Encountered quite a problem trying to do `import src.module`.
Best solution I found was to create a package from it and install it in my env.
The package specifics is placed in the `setup.py` file, and to install run

- `pip install -e .`
- `conda develop .`

Both are listed, but its proberbly best only to use venv or conda, so choose one ;)

# TODO
- [x] Add makes for root makefile to make things faster
